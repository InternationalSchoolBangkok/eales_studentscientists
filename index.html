<div id="">Student Research and Publishing Program in Secondary School Science</div>
StudentScientists.org is committed to turning science students into student scientists.  We have developed a program to achieve this,  the Student Research and Publishing Program (SRPP).  We have also developed a Model for Implementation of the SRPP as a guide for those interested in establishing the Program at their school.<br />
Learn more about the<a href="http://www.studentscientists.org/uploads/3/9/0/0/39003699/studentresearchandpublishing.pdf"> SRPP and how to implement it in your school.</a><br />
See the Publishing part of the Program, the <a href="http://www.isb.ac.th/HS/JoS/">ISB Journal of Science</a>, a peer-reviewed scientific journal dedicated to publishing the research of ISB students.<br />

About<br />
StudentScientists.org is an organization dedicated to improving science education.  We focus on helping secondary schools improve student learning in their science programs.  We have shown that the Student Research and Publishing Program, a science program in which students authentically experience the scientific process, results in significant gains in crucial areas of student learning.  StudentScientists.org's goal is to work with secondary schools to implement this program.<br />

If you are interested in implementing the Student Research and Publishing Program at your school, we would be more than happy to help guide you through the process. <br />
