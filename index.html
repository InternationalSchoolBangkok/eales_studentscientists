<div class="body">StudentScientists.org is committed to turning science students into student scientists.  We have developed a program to achieve this,  the Student Research and Publishing Program (SRPP).  We have also developed a Model for Implementation of the SRPP as a guide for those interested in establishing the Program at their school.<br />
Learn more about the<a href="http://www.studentscientists.org/uploads/3/9/0/0/39003699/studentresearchandpublishing.pdf"> SRPP and how to implement it in your school.</a><br />
See the Publishing part of the Program, the <a href="http://www.isb.ac.th/HS/JoS/">ISB Journal of Science</a>, a peer-reviewed scientific journal dedicated to publishing the research of ISB students.</div></div>
