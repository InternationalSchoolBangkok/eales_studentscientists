Student Research and Publishing Program in Secondary School Science
StudentScientists.org is committed to turning science students into student scientists.  We have developed a program to achieve this,  the Student Research and Publishing Program (SRPP).  We have also developed a Model for Implementation of the SRPP as a guide for those interested in establishing the Program at their school.

Learn more about the<a href="http://www.studentscientists.org/uploads/3/9/0/0/39003699/studentresearchandpublishing.pdf"> SRPP and how to implement it in your school.</a>

See the Publishing part of the Program, the ISB Journal of Science, a peer-reviewed scientific journal dedicated to publishing the research of ISB students.
